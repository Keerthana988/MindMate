                            Stress, depression, and anxiety are the diseases that have resonated the most in 2020;
                            however, the solution to this problem has existed for centuries. Meditation is one of the
                            most ancient and most used techniques to find greater mental and emotional stability. Thanks
                            to this cognitive training, anxiety, and stress are managed to achieve greater tranquility
                            in the day to day. The history of meditation is rooted in religion and spirituality but as
                            cultures and societies have changed, so has the practice.
                            People can experiment with various meditation techniques and determine which one works best
                            for them; however, regardless of age, this activity is intended to calm the mind to lead a
                            more peaceful and happy life.

                    <div class="col-md-7">
                        <p>Etymologically speaking, meditation comes from the Latin “meditari” and means reflect, think,
                            and contemplate. This practice is part of one of the branches that emerge from the Yoga
                            Sutras, and many define it as the way to exercise the mind to achieve greater spiritual
                            awareness and focus the thoughts on itself. While there’s no accurate way to date back the
                            beginning of people practicing meditation, some archeologists believe meditation goes as far
                            back as 5,000 B.C.

                        <p>
                            The history of meditation is very long. According to the texts written in 1500 BC by the
                            Hindus of Vedantism, meditation was developed centuries before they practiced it; however,
                            there is no exact date when it began to work.

                            According to historians, meditation dates back to 500 BC, which was when Taoism was
                            developed in China and the Buddhist religion in India. Hundreds of years later, Bhagavad
                            Gita devoted himself to writing a philosophical text dealing with meditation and yoga. He
                            explained how one could live a life with a higher spiritual level using both practices.

                            Already around 400 BC, the texts of The Yoga Sutras were written by the Hindu scholar
                            Patanjali, and it was at this time that meditation was considered step number 8 of the 9
                            that exist in yoga.

                            In the year 20 BC, meditation became known in the West, thanks to the philosopher Philo from
                            the Egyptian city, Alexandria, writing about various spiritual exercises that included the
                            mind’s concentration.

                            The philosopher Plato also developed various meditation techniques in the 3rd century.
                            However, they were not followed by many people. There is evidence in the Hebrew Bible that
                            people who belonged to the Jewish religion actively practiced meditation.

                    <h4 class="heading">How Old is Meditation?</h4>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>
                            The answer to that question is more complex than you might think. Different research, books,
                            and schools of meditation refer to the ‘age-old tradition’, but as to how long meditation
                            has been around as practice really depends on your definition of the concept.

                            Davanger (2008) reviewed a cross-section of research looking at meditation and speculated
                            that the practice might be as old as humanity itself with the potential meditative
                            capacities of Neanderthals. There are more schools of thought that have placed the origin of
                            meditation within a structured set of practices and techniques based on artifacts and
                            references in Eastern countries.

                            In a nutshell, no we don’t. Because the where and when are quite hazy, discovering the who
                            is equally ambiguous. Some of what we do know, however, indicates a few core people who have
                            been instrumental in spreading the practice of meditation. Below I’ve outlined three of the
                            key people, but there are many others who were equally prominent in sharing and spreading
                            the practice of meditation.

                            <span> Buddha (India)</span> <br>
                            The Buddha, known by other names including Siddhārtha Gautama in Sanskrit or Siddhattha
                            Gotama in Pali, was a prince who became a monk, sage, philosopher and religious leader. It
                            is his teachings on which Buddhism was founded.

                            Lao-Tze, also known by Lao-Tzu and Laozi, was an ancient Chinese philosopher whose name is
                            essentially an honor title meaning ‘Old Teacher’ or ‘Old Master’.

                            Dosho was a Japanese monk who, in the 7th century, traveled to China and studied Buddhism
                            under Hsuan Tsang, a great master at the time. It was during this journey that Dosho learned
                            all about the process of Zen, which he then returned to Japan with.

                            The history of meditation doesn’t only entail religion but also improving one’s own self and
                            wellbeing. One of the philosophies of meditation is that people manage to take
                            responsibility for their health and mental state. In this way, they can healthily live their
                            present and take those negative things that have passed through their lives as learning.

                            By being aware of each of the things that torment the mind and deciding to improve certain
                            aspects of life in the best way, people manage to cope with anxiety, fears, and confusion;
                            they tend to change how they react to adversity more smartly and healthily.

                            Remember that we all meditate in different ways, but you must do it in a place where you
                            have a lot of tranquility. You can incorporate relaxing music to the moments of the day that
                            you decide to meditate and begin to have a healthier life full of good energy.

                            While throughout history it was difficult to prove the positive effects of meditation
                            scientifically, we now have the tools to measure what meditation does to the brain. It was
                            shown in them that Marrhieu’s brain developed in the left pre-frontal cortex of the brain,
                            an activity superior to that of any other person. This was achieved thanks to the meditation
                            that he practiced daily.

                            In this way, science confirmed that the practice of meditation had achieved impressive
                            well-being in this monk’s life and that it predisposed him to manage stress intelligently
                            and manage negative emotions to enjoy positive ones.

                            Their motive behind this study was that, if those taxi drivers had achieved impressive
                            results in their brains due to their daily routine, what will happen to those who trained
                            them daily, with the conscious intention to improve their skills?

                            Tirthankara Mahavira, also known as Vardhamāna, is credited
                            with reviving Jainism. Tirthankara means ‘Ford Maker’ and the word indicates a founder of a
                            ‘tirtha’ – a passage across the sea of births and deaths. Mahavira was the twenty-fourth
                            Tirthankara. He put forward the spiritual, and ethical teachings of the Tirthankaras from
                            the pre-Vedic era that led to the revival of Jainism in India. As a practice, Jainism places
                            a strong emphasis on self-discipline and contemplation, as well as non-violence. The
                            meditative techniques in Jainism specifically focus on mantras, visualizations, and
                            breathing. <br>
